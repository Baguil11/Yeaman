5.0 - 4.95 == 0.05
False

This is an example of the round off error that is present in python and other languages. 
The floating point is not exactly represented in number, so when used in arithmetic the slight approximation causes the discrepancy. 
The Round function can be used compare the values as the slight approximation is taken into account.

round(0.1 + 0.5 + 0.6, 5)  == round(1.2, 5)
True

Computers use Binary, or Base2, to simplify the numbers. These bits are represented as 0 and 1, with each number represented as a power of 2. 
For example, 43 in Base10 would be: 32+8+2+1 = 2^5 + 0^4 + 2^3 + 0^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 101011
