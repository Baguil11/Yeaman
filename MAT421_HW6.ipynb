        "  Derivatives are used to mark change in a function. Derivatives decrease the order of the function by 1. For example, if a function is y= x^2, the derivative is 2x. The original derivative is called a limit. This is a function that slowly approaches a value but does not exactly. This concept is most important with the topic of continuity. Continuous functions are those that are real for every value and have a derivative that exists in both the left and right direction. This means that the absolute value of a function would not be continuous as there is one value for the derivative instead of two. \n",
        "  Derivatives and their functions can be multiplied by the multiplication and division rules. If a function raised to a power is being derived, the chain rule can be used."

        "Optimizations exist to minimize or maximize the effect of a function. Typically this is easily performed by taking the derivative of a fucntion and setting it equal to zero. This gives you an indicator for what value of 'x' gives you zero. This would be an example of a global minimization."
